# 8.7 - Electric Flux

## 8.7.1 - Dot Product

Before we talk about electric flux, let's do a quick refresher of dot products.

Definition: a vector operation that results in a **scalar** product

$\overrightarrow{A} \cdot \overrightarrow{B} = |\overrightarrow{A}\space||\overrightarrow{B}\space|\space cos(\theta)$

![Dot product](8.7-Images/Dot-Product.svg)

- Dot products are the highest when $\theta = 0$ (parallel)
- Dot products are the least when $\theta = 90$ (perpendicular)

This concept will come in later.

## 8.7.2 - Flux

### Working With Air

Earlier we learned about electric fields and their interactions with objects. However, we have not yet covered the idea of an electric field passing through a surface. By definition, the meaning of flux is *flow*; a measurement of flux is a measurement of flow, or how much *something* passes through an area. For example, an in*flux* of people is the amount of people going into an **area.**

Before tackling electric flux, consider this example. Let's assume that air is traveling through a vent of area $A = 4\text{m}^2$ at a velocity of $v = 10\text{m/s}$. How can we calculate the flux in this scenario? Well, flux is nothing but flow, so we are trying to calculate the amount of air that flows out of this vent every second.

![Image of air flowing out a vent](8.7-Images/Flux-Air.svg)

Because the air is moving at $10m/s$, that means a particle of air will be 10 meters away from the event at $t = 1s$. We also know that the vent is $4m^{2}$. To calculate the flux, or how much air flows out per second, we multiply the velocity and the area to get $10\frac{m}{s} \times 4m^{2} = 40\frac{m^{3}}{s}$. Thus, the flux of *air* is 40 cubic meters per second. Pretty easy, right!

Now, let's make an equation representing this situation!

We can get the equation $\Phi_A = V_{\perp}A$. This says that the flux, or flow, of air (represented by $\Phi_A$) is equivalent to the velocity of the air multiplied by the area of the outlet, or the vent.

In case of our example, the equation represents the following: $airflow = air \space speed \times vent \space area$.

It is important to note that $V$ is the velocity vector that is perpendicular to the air vent. Looking at our example, you'll see that the arrows for the airflow are perpendicular to the vent. They are not angled.

### Working With Electricity

In order to apply this to electric flux rather than air flux, we can use our equation from earlier but replace a few variables to apply it to electricity. We first replace the velocity vector $V$ with an electric field fector $\overrightarrow{E}$. We also replace $\Phi_A$ with $\Phi_E$ because we need electric flux, not air flux. So, our formula turns into the following:  $\Phi_E = \overrightarrow{E_{\perp}}\cdot\overrightarrow{A}$.

We will also replace $\overrightarrow{E_{\perp}}$ with $\overrightarrow{E}cos(\theta)$. See [8.7.1](8.7-gauss.md#871---dot-product) for more details.

:::tip[Key Equation]

$\Phi_E = EA_{\perp} = EAcos(\theta)$

$\theta$ is the angle between the electric field vector and an imaginary line that is perpendicular to the area. See [8.7.1](8.7-gauss.md#871---dot-product) for more details.

:::info[Sample Question]

A large flat metal sheet lies horizontally on the ground under a uniformly distributed electric field. A circular loop of radius $r = 0.4\text{m}$ is held perpendicular to the field lines, which point vertically upward with a constant magnitude of $E = 250 \space \text{N/C}$. What is the total electric flux $\Phi_E$ through the loop?

$\Phi_E = EA\cos\theta$.
Since the electric field is perpendicular to the loop, $\theta = 0^\circ$, and $\cos\theta = 1$

$A = \pi r^2 = \pi (0.4)^2 = 0.16\pi\text{m}^2$

$\Phi_E = (250)(0.16\pi) = 40\pi \space \text{N} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{C}$

$\Phi_E \approx 125.7 \space \text{N} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{C}$

### Flux on a Complex Surface

What if we are now working with complex surfaces? Like maybe a closed surface? The area of that will not only be too complex to find, but the electric flux will differ at each part of the figure due to the differing orientations of the perpendicular surface and the electric field vector.

![Image of flux of a complex shape](8.7-Images/Complex-Flux.png)

Well, in physics we usually see that whenever there is a problem concerning multiple infinitely small pieces, especially in an equation, the answer almost always requires calculus. Imagine if we separated this complex figure into multiple squares. In a closed surface such as the surface of the sphere we are analyzing the flux of the electric field vector entering and exiting. So if the field lines go outwards, the electric flux is positive. If the field lines go inwards, the electric flux is negative. A flux of 0 means that the electric field vector is parallel to the surface itself.

:::tip[Key Equation]

$\Phi_E = \oint \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A}$

**Note:** The integral with a ring in it represents the integral of a closed path or a surface. Evaluating it may be a bit complex, but that is where Gauss's Law comes in. Gauss's Law will let us find the quantity above easily.

## 8.7.3 - Gauss's Law

The way that Gauss's Law was first derived was by looking at electric flux through a sphere. Consider a point charge $\mathbf{q}$ such that $\mathbf{q}$ is placed in the center of a sphere of radius $\mathbf{r}$. The electric field generated in this setup can be represented as $\mathbf{E} = \frac{k_e q}{r^2}$. The electric field generated by the charge radiates outward, so every chunk of area $\mathbf{dA}$ on the sphere has an electric field vector which is perpendicular to it. Using this information, we can derive the net electric flux for the sphere as shown below.

$E = \frac{k_e q}{r^2}$

Since the electric field $\mathbf{E}$ is radial and constant over the surface, and  
$\mathbf{E} \parallel d\mathbf{A}$ at every point, the differential flux is:

$d\Phi_E = \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = E \, dA$

The total electric flux through the surface is:

$\Phi_E = \oint \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = E \oint dA = E \cdot A$

For a sphere, the total area is $A = 4\pi r^2$, so:

$\Phi_E = \left( \frac{k_e q}{r^2} \right)(4\pi r^2) = 4\pi k_e q$

Using the identity $k_e = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0}$, we get:

$\Phi_E = \frac{q}{\varepsilon_0}$

However, this derived equation for the net flux can actually be used for any closed surface due to the nature of electric fields and vector calculus. Charges outside the closed surface have electric field lines which enter and leave therefore their effect on the net flux is 0. **Gauss's Law works for any closed surface no matter its shape**

:::tip[Key Equation]

$\Phi_E = \oint \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \frac{q}{\varepsilon_0}$
