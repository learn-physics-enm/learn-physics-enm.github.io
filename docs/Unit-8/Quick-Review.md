## Equations

### Electric Force

* $F_{e} = k_{e}\cdot\frac{|q_{1}|\cdot|q_{2}|}{r^{2}}$
  * $F_{e}$ = electric force
  * $k_{e}$ = Coulomb's constant
  * $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ = the two charges
  * $r$ = distance between the charges

### Electric Fields

* $\mathbf{E} = \frac{\mathbf{F}_{e}}{q_{0}}$
  * $\mathbf{E}$ = the electric field vector
  * $\mathbf{F}_{e}$ = the electrical force
  * $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ = the two charges
  * $q_{0}$ = the positive test charge
* $\mathbf{F}_{e}  = q\mathbf{E}$
  * Alternate form of the equation above

<br></br>

* $\mathbf{E} = k_{e}\frac{q}{r^{2}}\mathbf{\hat{r}}$
  * $k_{e}$ = Coulomb's constant
  * $q$ = the magnitude of force between the point charge ($q$) and the test charge
  * $r^{2}$ = the distance between the point charge ($q$) and the point of interest
* $\mathbf{E} = k_{e}\sum_{i}^{}\frac{q_{i}}{r^{2}_{i}}\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{i}$.
  * $r_{i}$ = the distance between the $i$th source charge $q_{i}$ and point $P$
  * $\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{i}$ = a unit vector directed from $q_{i}$ toward $P$
  * All other variables are the same as the equation above

### Charge Density

* Charge density formulas:
  * Volume: $dq = \rho dV$
  * Surface: $dq = \sigma dV$
  * Line: $dq = \lambda dV$

#### Linear Charge Density

* $\mathbf{N} = \mathbf{C} q$
  * $\mathbf{N}$ = the number of lines
  * $\mathbf{q}$ = the charge
  * $\mathbf{C}$ = a constant

### Charged Particle Motion

* $\Delta x = v_{i}t + \frac{q\mathbf{E}}{2m}t^{2}$
* $v_{f} = v_{i} + \frac{q\mathbf{E}}{m}t$
* $v_{f}^{2} = v_{i}^{2} +\frac{2q\mathbf{E}}{m}\Delta x$

<br></br>

* For ALL equations listed above:
  * $q$ = the charge
  * $\mathbf{E}$ = the electric field
  * $m$ = the mass of the charge (sometimes listed as $m_{e}$)

### Work and Energy

* $W = q\mathbf{E}\Delta x$
* $\Delta K = q\mathbf{E}\Delta x$

<br></br>

* For ALL equations listed above:
  * $q$ = the charge
  * $\mathbf{E}$ = the electric field

### Gauss's Law

* $\Phi_E = EA_{\perp} = EAcos(\theta)$
  * $A_{\perp}$ = the area perpendicular to the electric field vectors
  * $E$ = the electric field
  * $\theta$ = the angle between the electric field line and an imaginary line that is perpendicular to the area
* $\Phi_E = \oint \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A}$
  * **Note:** you most likely won't have to worry about this equation. Most problems don't need this difficult calculus, so you can often use the easier formula listed below.
  * $\oint \mathbf{E}$ = the surface integral of where the field is being produced/emitted
* $\Phi_E = \frac{q}{\varepsilon_0}$
  * $q$ = the electric charge
  * $\varepsilon_0$ = permittivity of free space

<br></br>

* For ALL equations listed above:
  * $\Phi_E$ = the electric flux

## Constants

* $k_{e} = 8.9875 \times 10^{9} \text{ N} \cdot \text{m}^{2}/\text{C}^{2} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}$
  * Coulomb's Constant
* $\epsilon_{0} = 8.8542 \times 10^{-12} \text{ C}^{2} / \text{ N} \cdot \text{m}^{2}$
  * Permittivity of free space in a vacuum
