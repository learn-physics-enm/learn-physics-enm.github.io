# 8.8 - Electric Flux

## 8.8.1 - Dot Product

Before we talk about electric flux, let's do a quick refresher of dot products.

Definition: a vector operation that results in a **scalar** product

$\large \overrightarrow{A} \cdot \overrightarrow{B} = |\overrightarrow{A}\space||\overrightarrow{B}\space|\space cos(\theta)$

![Dot product](8.9-Images/Dot-Product.svg)

- Dot products are the highest when $\theta = 0$ (parallel)
- Dot products are the least when $\theta = 90$ (perpendicular)

This concept will come in later.

## 8.8.2 - Flux

### Working With Air

Earlier we learned about electric fields and their interactions with objects. However, we have not yet covered the idea of an electric field passing through a surface. By definition, the meaning of flux is *flow*; a measurement of flux is a measurement of flow, or how much *something* passes through an area. For example, an in*flux* of people is the amount of people going into an **area.**

Before tackling electric flux, consider this example. Let's assume that air is traveling through a vent of area $A = 4\text{m}^2$ at a velocity of $v = 10\text{m/s}$. How can we calculate the flux in this scenario? Well, flux is nothing but flow, so we are trying to calculate the amount of air that flows out of this vent every second.

![Image of air flowing out a vent](8.9-Images/Flux-Air.svg)

Because the air is moving at $10m/s$, that means a particle of air will be 10 meters away from the event at $t = 1s$. We also know that the vent is $4m^{2}$. To calculate the flux, or how much air flows out per second, we multiply the velocity and the area to get $10\frac{m}{s} \times 4m^{2} = 40\frac{m^{3}}{s}$. Thus, the flux of *air* is 40 cubic meters per second. Pretty easy, right!

Now, let's make an equation representing this situation!

We can get the equation $\Phi_A = V_{\perp}A$. This says that the flux, or flow, of air (represented by $\Phi_A$) is equivalent to the velocity of the air multiplied by the area of the outlet, or the vent.

In case of our example, the equation represents the following: $airflow = air \space speed \times vent \space area$.

It is important to note that $V$ is the velocity vector that is perpendicular to the air vent. Looking at our example, you'll see that the arrows for the airflow are perpendicular to the vent. They are not angled.

### Working With Electricity

In order to apply this to electric flux rather than air flux, we can use our equation from earlier but replace a few variables to apply it to electricity. We first replace the velocity vector $V$ with an electric field fector $\overrightarrow{E}$. We also replace $\Phi_A$ with $\Phi_E$ because we need electric flux, not air flux. So, our formula turns into the following:  $\Phi_E = \overrightarrow{E_{\perp}}\cdot\overrightarrow{A}$.

We will also replace $\overrightarrow{E_{\perp}}$ with $\overrightarrow{E}cos(\theta)$. See [8.8.1](8.9-gauss.md#871---dot-product) for more details.

:::tip[Key Equation]

$\large \Phi_E = EA_{\perp} = EAcos(\theta)$

$\theta$ is the angle between the electric field vector and an imaginary line that is perpendicular to the area. See [8.8.1](8.9-gauss.md#871---dot-product) for more details.

:::info[Sample Question]

A large flat metal sheet lies horizontally on the ground under a uniformly distributed electric field. A circular loop of radius $r = 0.4\text{m}$ is held perpendicular to the field lines, which point vertically upward with a constant magnitude of $E = 250 \space \text{N/C}$. What is the total electric flux $\Phi_E$ through the loop?

$\large \Phi_E = EA\cos\theta$.

Since the electric field is perpendicular to the loop, $\theta = 0^\circ$, and $\cos\theta = 1$

$\large A = \pi r^2 = \pi (0.4)^2 = 0.16\pi\text{m}^2$

$\large \Phi_E = (250)(0.16\pi) = 40\pi \space \text{N} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{C}$

$\large \Phi_E \approx 125.7 \space \text{N} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{C}$

### Flux on a Complex Surface

What if we are now working with complex surfaces? We know that the electric flux will differ at each part of the figure due to the differing orientations of the perpendicular surface and the electric field vector.

![Image of flux of a complex shape](8.9-Images/Complex-Flux.png)

So, how should we find the flux of a weird shape? As you recall from center of mass, we will need calculus.

Consider this: imagine if we separated the complex figure above into multiple squares, as depicted. In a closed surface, such as the surface of a sphere, we are analyzing the flux of the electric field vector entering and exiting. So, if the field lines go outwards, the electric flux is positive. If the field lines go inwards, the electric flux is negative. A flux of 0 means that the electric field vector is parallel to the surface itself.

:::tip[Key Equation]

$\large \Phi_E = \oint \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A}$

**Note:** The integral with a ring in it represents the integral of a closed path or a surface. Evaluating it may be a bit complex, but that is where Gauss's Law comes in. Gauss's Law will let us easily find the quantity above.

### Practice Problems

:::info[Practice Problem 1]

A square surface with sides of $1~\text{m} \times 1~\text{m}$ located over the $xy$-plane, where a constant electric field with a magnitude of $200~\text{N} \cdot \text{m}^2 / \text{C}$ presents. The direction of the electric field vector is depicted in the figure. What is the total electric flux through the open surface?

Solution:

Since the electric field is constant and the surface is flat, we can use the electric flux formula:
$\large \Phi_e = EA \cos \theta$
Note that the given angle is not the angle we want to use in the flux formula. The correct angle between $\vec{E}$ and $\hat{n}$ is $180^\circ - 72^\circ$ (refer to the previous problem). Therefore, the electric flux through the surface is:

$\large \Phi_E = EA \cos \theta$
$\large = 200 \times (1)^2 \times \cos(180^\circ - 72^\circ)$
$\large = 200 \times 1 \times \cos(108^\circ)$
$\large = 200 \times (-0.309)$
$\large = -61.8~\text{N} \cdot \text{m}^2 / \text{C}$

:::info[Problem 2]

At the center of a sphere of radius $0.5$m a point charge of $2~\mu$C is placed. What electric flux is passing through the sphere?

Solution:

Electric flux is defined as:
$\large \Phi_E = EA\cos\theta$
Since the electric field is perpendicular to the surface at all points on the sphere, $\large \theta = 0^\circ$, and $\cos\theta = 1$.

The area of the sphere is:
$\large A = 4\pi r^2 = 4\pi (0.5)^2 = \pi~\text{m}^2$

First, calculate the electric field at the surface:
$\large E = k\frac{q}{r^2} = (8.99 \times 10^9)\frac{2 \times 10^{-6}}{(0.5)^2} = 71920~\text{N/C}$

Now calculate the flux:
$\large \Phi_E = EA = (71920)(\pi) = 71920\pi~\text{N} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{C}$
$\large \Phi_E \approx 2.26 \times 10^5~\text{N} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{C}$

Consequently, the electric flux passing through the sphere is approximately $\large 2.26 \times 10^5~\text{N} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{C}$.

:::info[Problem 3]

A $2~\text{cm} \times 2~\text{cm}$ square lies in the $xy$-plane. Find the electric flux through the square for each of the following electric field vectors.

(a) $\large \vec{E} = (50\hat{i} + 20\hat{j})~\text{N/C}$

(b) $\large \vec{E} = (50\hat{k} + 20\hat{j})~\text{N/C}$

Solution:

The electric flux through a surface is given by:
$\large \Phi_E = \vec{E} \cdot \vec{A}$
where $\vec{A} = A\hat{n}$ is the area vector perpendicular to the surface.

Since the square lies in the $xy$-plane, its area vector is:
$\large \vec{A} = A\hat{k} = (0.02 \times 0.02)\hat{k} = (4 \times 10^{-4})\hat{k}~\text{m}^2$

(a) For $\vec{E} = (50\hat{i} + 20\hat{j})~\text{N/C}$:
$\large \Phi_E = \vec{E} \cdot \vec{A} = (50\hat{i} + 20\hat{j}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{-4}\hat{k}) = 0$
Since neither component of $\vec{E}$ has a $\hat{k}$ component, the dot product is zero.

(b) For $\vec{E} = (50\hat{k} + 20\hat{j})~\text{N/C}$:
$\large \Phi_E = \vec{E} \cdot \vec{A} = (50\hat{k} + 20\hat{j}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{-4}\hat{k}) = 50 \times 4 \times 10^{-4} = 0.02~\text{N} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{C}$
Only the $\hat{k}$ component of $\vec{E}$ contributes to the flux through the $xy$-plane.

## 8.8.3 - Gauss's Law

Consider a point charge $\mathbf{q}$ that is placed in the center of a sphere of radius $\mathbf{r}$. The electric field generated can be represented as $\mathbf{E} = \frac{k_e q}{r^2}$. The electric field generated by the charge radiates outward, so every chunk of area $\mathbf{dA}$ on the sphere has an electric field vector that is perpendicular to it. Using this information, we can derive the net electric flux for the sphere as shown below.

$\large \mathbf{E} = \frac{k_e q}{r^2}$

Since the electric field $\mathbf{E}$ is radial and constant over the surface, and  
$\mathbf{E} \parallel d\mathbf{A}$ at every point, the differential flux is:

$\large d\Phi_E = \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = E \, dA$

The total electric flux through the surface is:

$\large \Phi_E = \oint \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = E \oint dA = E \cdot A$

For a sphere, the total area is $A = 4\pi r^2$, so:

$\large \Phi_E = \left( \frac{k_e q}{r^2} \right)(4\pi r^2) = 4\pi k_e q$

Using the identity $k_e = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0}$, we get:

$\large \Phi_E = \frac{q}{\varepsilon_0}$

However, this derived equation for the net flux can actually be used for *any* closed surface. **Gauss's Law works for any closed surface, no matter its shape.**

:::tip[Key Equation]

$\large \Phi_E = \oint \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \frac{q}{\varepsilon_0}$
