# 8.1 - Introduction to Electrical Charges

## 8.1.1 - Electrical Charge

### History

In the mid 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted a series of experiments concerning the attraction between objects and their electrical properties. He would work with materials such as glass rods, silk, and metal, while analyzing their behavior when rubbed against one another. The idea that opposite charges attract and like charges repel was already observed by many, but he tried to uncover the inner workings behind this concept. His idea of *positive charges* and *negative charges* went on to become a strong foundation for the field of electromagnetism.

### Foundational Concepts

Have you ever rubbed a balloon against your hair and stuck it to a wall? There's no glue or adhesives, so how does it stay up? Based on the title, you can probably guess the reason: electrical charge!

When such materials (like the balloon) act like this, they are considered *electrified* or **electrically charged**. When Franklin conducted his experiments, he discovered a set of foundational concepts that govern electrical charges.

:::tip[Key Concepts]

* Like charges repel (ex: positive and positive); opposite charges attract (ex: positive and negative)
  * You most likely know this one!
* Negative charges are possessed by electrons
* Positive charges are possessed by protons
* Electrical charge is ALWAYS conserved
  * You will probably recognize that this is similar to most other laws of conservation in physics.
* Electrical charges are quantized

Don't worry if this doesn't make sense right now. We will go over everything in detail below:

### Negative and Positive Charges

As you may recall, an atom is made up of *electrons (-)*, *protons (+)*, and *neutrons (0, or no charge)*. Depending on the combinations of electrons, protons and neutrons, the atom is then either positively or negatively charged.

* Positively charged objects are at a **loss** of electrons. Their net charge is positive because there are fewer electrons than there are protons.
* Negatively charged objects are at a **gain** of extra electrons. Their charge is negative because there are fewer protons than there are electrons

### Quantization of Charge

In 1909, Rober Millikan performed the oil drop experiment. In this experiment, he carefully measured the electrical charge on tiny oil droplets suspended in an electric field. He found that charge is *quantized*, denoted by the variable $q$, and is **always** an integral multiple of an amount of charge $e$.

:::note

An integral multiple is a number resulting from multiplying an integer with a whole number. In other words, it means a whole number multiplied by another whole number. For example, $10$ is an integral multiple of $2$ because $2 \cdot 5 = 10$.

:::

In other words...

* Charges **MUST** be present in discrete forms, or whole numbers: you cannot have half a charge. Additionally, you cannot have half an electron.
* Charges are made of $e$, or the elementary charge (some call it fundamental charge).
* Charge can exist in bundles. For example, $10e$ is a bundle of 10 elementary charges.
* Charge is a scalar quantity

These rules can be defined in the formula $q = Ne$ where $q$ is the total charge, $N$ is an integer number (positive or negative), and $e$ is the elementary charge.

Furthermore, it was found that:

* Electrons have a charge of $-e$
* Protons have a charge of $+e$
* Neutrons have a charge of $0$
* Negatively charged objects have the charge $Ne$ where $N \lt 0$ (ex: $-2e$)
* Positively charged objects have the charge $Ne$ where $N \gt 0$ (ex: $+2e$)

:::tip[Key Concepts]

* There are two types of charges: charges of opposite signs attract and charges of the same sign repel
* Total charge in an isolated system is conserved (conservation of charge)
* Charge is *quantized*

### Conservation of Electrical Charge

Electrical charge within a *closed system* isn't created or destroyed. The total net electrical charge will always remain the same, even if the charges move around. The conservation of electrical charge is just like other conservation laws. For example, the conservation of energy, which you learned in mechanics, states that the total net energy in a system remains the same. Energy could be transferred (ex: from potential to kinetic), but there is never any loss or gain. The only exception to this would be external forces like friction. However, the closed system becomes an *open system*. That is why a loss occurs

It is also important to note that **electrons move, but protons don't**. That is because the protons are bound extremely tightly to the nucleus, so they are unable to escape. Electrons, however, can float around freely and move.

Let's say that you have two objects: one is positively charged (which we will call object P) and one is negatively charged (which we will call object N). Recall that an object's charge is determined by their electron and proton count. Object P has *less* electrons (-) than protons (+), so it has a *net-positive* charge. Object P has *more* electrons (-) than protons (+), so it has a *net-negative* charge. The attraction between these two oppositely charged objects occurs because Object N's electrons attract to Object P's net-positive charge.

### Ground

When we attach a grounding wire to an object, we are essentially connecting it to a reservoir, like Earth, that can accept and provide electrons freely with negligible effects. Think of a grounding wire like a pipe to the ocean. Because the ocean is massive, any water that we add or remove won't have a noticeable effect on the ocean's overall water amount. Similarly, any electrons which are accepted or provided to Earth (ground) won't affect Earth's overall charge.

Attaching a system to ground allows charges to freely flow in and out of it to reach electrostatic equilibrium. However, this doesn't necessarily mean it will become a neutral charge.

:::note

Electrostatic equilibrium is covered in detail later.

### Conductors and Insulators

* Conductors (e.g. Copper) are materials in which some electrons are free and can move throughout the material.
* Insulators (e.g. Wood) are materials in which all electrons are bound to the atoms and can't move freely at all.
* Semiconductors (e.g. Silicon) have properties similar to both conductors and insulators.

## 8.1.2 Polarization

Let's say that you rub a balloon against your hair. You probably know that when you lift the balloon, your hair will lift up too. We know this because the balloon has been negatively charged via friction while the hair has been positively charged. This creates an attractive force, so the hair is pulled up.

However, what happens when we put the balloon near some small pieces of paper? The papers jump up and stick to the balloon! But how could this be? The paper was never charged to begin with, and it started off neutral. The answer: polarization.

Remember how the process of charging an object with induction worked? When we brought the square object (net negative charge) near the circular one (net neutral), the electrons *within the circle* moved away from the square. This resulted in one side having a more negative charge and one side having a more positive charge. Remember, the **overall net charge remained the same.** All that changes was the charge level on each *side* of the object.

Similarly, when we hold the negatively charged balloon to the neutral paper, the negative charges within the paper's atoms will move *away* from the balloon because they are repelled, and the positive charges will move *closer* to the balloon because they are attracted. This results in the paper atoms having one side that is more negative and one side that is more positive. That is called **polarization.** When the paper is polarized, it will stick to the balloon because the positive charge wants to touch the negative balloon.

:::note

The force of electrical attraction is similar to gravity, becoming stronger when the distance between two charged objects is shorter. That is why the paper sticks to the balloon: the forces of attraction between the positive charges of the paper atoms and the negative charges of the balloon are stronger.

If that didn't make sense, don't worry! What we just talked about is a little out of our scope for this lesson. It will be covered in detail in later lessons.
