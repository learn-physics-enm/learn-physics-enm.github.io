# 8.1 - Introduction to Electrical Charges

## 8.1.1 - Electrical Charge

### History

In the mid 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted a series of experiments concerning the attraction between objects and their electrical properties. He would work with materials such as glass rods, silk, and metal, while analyzing their behavior when rubbed against one another. The idea that opposite charges attract and like charges repel was already observed by many, but he tried to uncover the inner workings behind this concept. His idea of *positive charges* and *negative charges* went on to become a strong foundation for the field of electromagnetism.

### Foundational Concepts

Have you ever rubbed a balloon against your hair and stuck it to a wall? There's no glue or adhesives, so how does it stay up? Based on the title, you can probably guess the reason: electrical charge!

When such materials (like the balloon) act like this, they are considered *electrified* or **electrically charged**. When Franklin conducted his experiments, he discovered a set of foundational concepts that govern electrical charges.

:::tip[Key Concepts]

- Like charges repel (ex: positive and positive); opposite charges attract (ex: positive and negative)
  - You most likely know this one!
- Negative charges are possessed by electrons
- Positive charges are possessed by protons
- Electrical charge is ALWAYS conserved
  - You will probably recognize that this is similar to most other laws of conservation in physics.
  - In the balloon example, the *transfer* charge is what makes it electrified. One object gains some negative charge while the other gains an equal amount of positive charge. Remember from mechanics: opposite and equal!
- Electrical charges are quantized

### Negative and Positive Charges

As you may recall, an atom is made up of *electrons (-)*, *protons (+)*, and *neutrons (0, or no charge)*. Depending on the combinations of electrons, protons and neutrons, the atom is then either positively or negatively charged.

Positively charged objects are at a loss of electrons. Their net charge is positive because there are fewer electrons than there are protons.

Negatively charged objects are at a gain of extra electrons. Their charge is negative because there are fewer protons than there are electrons

### Conservation of Electrical Charge

Electrical charge is never actually created. It is conserved through a transfer of electrons between charged objects. This transfer creates attraction.

It is also important to note that *electrons move, but protons don't*. Let's say that you have two objects: one is positively charged (which we will call object P) and one is negatively charged (which we will call object N). Recall that an object's charge is determined by their electron and proton count. Object P has *less* electrons (-) than protons (+), so it has a *net-positive* charge. Object P has *more* electrons (-) than protons (+), so it has a *net-negative* charge. The attraction between these two oppositely charged objects occurs because Object N's electrons attract to Object P's net-positive charge. The electrons move, but the protons don't.

### Quantization of Charge

In 1909, Rober Millikan performed the oil drop experiment. In this experiment, he carefully measured the electrical charge on tiny oil droplets suspended in an electric field. He found that charge is *quantized*, denoted by the variable $q$, and is always an integral multiple of an amount of charge $e$.

:::note

An integral multiple is a number resulting from multiplying an integer with a whole number. In other words, it means a whole number multiplied by another whole number. For example, $10$ is an integral multiple of $2$ because $2 \cdot 5 = 10$.

:::

In other words, charges MUST be present in discrete forms, or whole numbers; you cannot have half a charge. Additionally, you cannot have half an electron. It also means that charges exist in "bundles."

Foundationally, this became the formula $q = Ne$ such that $q$ is the total charge, $N$ is an integer number, positive or negative, and $e$ is the elementary charge.

The idea became that:

- Electrons have a charge of $-e$, and negatively charged objects can have charges like $-2e$ and $-3e$
- Protons have a charge of $+e$, and positively charged objects can have charges like $+2e$ and $+3e$
- Neutrons have a charge of $0$

:::tip[Key Concepts]

- There are two types of charges: charges of opposite signs attract and charges of the same sign repel
- Total charge in an isolated system is conserved (conservation of charge)
- Charge is *quantized*

## 8.1.2 Charging Objects by Induction

### Conductors and Insulators

- **Conductors** (e.g. Copper) are materials in which some electrons are free and can move throughout the material.
- **Insulators** (e.g. Wood) are materials in which all electrons are bound to the atoms and can't move freely at all.
- **Semiconductors** (e.g. Silicon) have properties similar to both conductors and insulators.

### Charging Objects by Induction

Induction is the process of charging a conductor, such as a metal, without touching it. Below is an example of how this works:

<hr></hr>

![Step 1](8.1-Images/Induction-Step-1.svg)

A conductive metal object, which we will call Object M, starts with a neutral charge (equal electrons and protons).

<hr></hr>

![Step 2](8.1-Images/Induction-Step-2.svg)

Object M is brought near another object. However, the second object, which we will call Object C, is charged. Let's say that Object C has a negative charge.

<hr></hr>

![Step 3](8.1-Images/Induction-Step-3.svg)

When we bring Object C near Object M, any electrons in M that are close to C will be repelled due to C's negative charge. Remember: since Object M is made up of conductive metal, the electrons can move around freely. Therefore, the electrons will move to the other side of M.

<hr></hr>

![Step 4](8.1-Images/Induction-Step-4.svg)

Now, the part of Object M that was closest to Object C will have an overall positive charge since those electrons moved away. However, Object M still won't be charged! The reason is because the electrons haven't left M. They are still there but have just moved away from where Object C is. When we remove Object C, the electrons won't be repelled anymore and the overall charge of Object M won't be different. To make Object M charged, we need to **ground** it.

The wire connected to the three bars is the symbol for ground.

When we attach a grounding wire to Object M, we are essentially connecting it to a reservoir, like Earth, which can accept and provide electrons freely with negligible effects. Think of a grounding wire like a pipe to the ocean. Because the ocean is massive, any water that we add or remove won't have a noticeable effect on the ocean's overall water amount. Similarly, any electrons which are accepted or provided to Earth (ground) won't affect Earth's overall charge.

<hr></hr>

![Step 6](8.1-Images/Induction-Step-6.svg)

After we ground Object M, some of the repelled electrons that have moved to the other side will end up escaping through the wire and entering Earth.

<hr></hr>

![Step 7](8.1-Images/Induction-Step-7.svg)

When you cut off the ground connection, Object M will have more protons than electrons because those repelled electrons have left. Therefore, the overall charge will be *positive*.

<hr></hr>

![Step 8](8.1-Images/Induction-Step-8.svg)

We can remove object C. Thus, we have used induction to positively charge Object M!
