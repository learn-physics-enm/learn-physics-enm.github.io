# 8.5 - Electric Fields in Conductors and Insluators

## 8.5.1 - Electrostatic Equilibrium, Conductors, and Insluators In-Depth

### Electrostatic Equilibrium In-Depth

You can think of electrostatic equilibirum like static equilibrium. In static equilbrium, the net forces all go to zero. Similarly, in electrostatic equilibirum means, the net force on all charges is zero.

$\sum_{}^{}\overrightarrow{F} = 0$

In other words, there is no change in the charge distribution. This does **not** mean that there are no forces present. For example, in static equilbrium, there are still forces present but they just sum to zero.

### Conductors In-Depth

Conductors have the following properties:

* Electrons can easily move through the material, so there is *high* electric permittivity.
* When a conductor is in electrostatic equilibrium, the extra charge is on the *surface* of the conductor.

### Insluators In-Depth

Insulators have the following properties:

* Electrons can't move easily through the material and are bound to the molecular structure, so there is *low* electric permittivity.
* When an insulator is in electrostatic equilibrium, the extra charge is on the *throughout the entire material* of the insulator. This *includes* the surface.

## Equations and Constants

**Equations**

* $\large \mathbf{E} = \frac{\mathbf{F}_{e}}{q_{0}}$
  * $\mathbf{E}$ = the electric field vector
  * $\mathbf{F}_{e}$ = the electrical force
  * $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ = the two charges
  * $q_{0}$ = the positive test charge
* $\large \mathbf{F}_{e}  = q\mathbf{E}$
  * Alternate form of the equation above
* $\large \mathbf{E} = k_{e}\frac{q}{r^{2}}\mathbf{\hat{r}}$
  * $k_{e}$ = Coulomb's constant
  * $q$ = the magnitude of force between the point charge ($q$) and the test charge
  * $r^{2}$ = the distance between the point charge ($q$) and the point of interest
* $\large \mathbf{E} = k_{e}\sum_{i}^{}\frac{q_{i}}{r^{2}_{i}}\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{i}$.
  * $r_{i}$ = the distance between the $i$th source charge $q_{i}$ and point $P$
  * $\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{i}$ = a unit vector directed from $q_{i}$ toward $P$
  * All other variables are the same as the equation above
