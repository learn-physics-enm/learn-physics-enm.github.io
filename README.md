# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

**Important:** do NOT touch any files in the `build` folder. You must write your documentation in the `docs` folder.
**Important:** do NOT modify the `node_modules` folder and do NOT remove it from the `.gitignore`.
**Important:** do NOT modify any docker related filed.

Want to add custom assets? Add it in the corresponding unit folder or add it in the `static` folder for site-wide access. For example, files for Latex support have been added there.

Want the change the style of something? Go to the `src/css/custom.css` folder. If you want to change the site's info, modify the configuration files there OR change the `docusaurus.config.js` in the root directory.

- When developing a table, use [this website](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables).
- When making latex, use [this website](https://latexeditor.lagrida.com/).
- When making a diagram, use [this website](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L6r8jAqQatDtlMlTHIBmHaUcrfzt4tAQ/view?usp=sharing).
  - **Important:** Follow these instructions below to make sure your diagram is exported properly:
    - At the top right, click File > Export as > SVG
    - Set Zoom to 100%, enable Transparent Background, set Appearance to Automatic. Keep everything else as default.
    - Select Export
    - You can set your file name here. Set Where to Download. This saves it locally to your computer.
    - Drag the SVG file to the site files and place it where you need it to be.

## Using Docker

1. Pull the docker image using `docker pull kinetekenergy/learn-physics-enm:latest`. You can view it [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/kinetekenergy/learn-physics-enm/general) on DockerHub.
2. Run `docker compose up --build` to start the site.
   1. Run `docker compose down` to stop the site.
3. Go to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser to see the site.
4. Changes made to docs should update instantly

Note: when building the site, docusaurus will give unsupported file type errors for the SVGs. Ignore them.

## Installation

```bash
yarn
```

## Local Development

```bash
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

Using SSH:

```bash
USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

Not using SSH:

```bash
GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.

## Design

Our color scheme comes from [Google's Material 3](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/static/baseline).
